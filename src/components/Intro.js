      Welcome! My name is Kimberly Blankenstein, and I work as a Senior Software
      Engineer for Lockheed Martin Space, located in Colorado. For over twenty
      years, I have been independently researching and sharing the life story of
      Flight Officer Joseph H. Noyes, from Seattle â€” a Flying Fortress pilot who
      served with the 95th Bomb Group (H) during the Second World War.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a teenager, I became uniquely fascinated with World War Two, and The
      Mighty Eighth Air Force, and I spent countless hours immersed in military
      history reading material. Then, I stumbled across the book B-17s Over
      Berlin on a shelf at a bookstore and noticed a group photograph within its
      pages, and in that photograph, by some destiny, I found Joe Noyes.
      <br />
      <br />
      In answer to a question I get asked frequently, I am not related to anyone
      who served on The Joe Noyes Crew or a veteran of the 95th Bomb Group (H).
      I am a volunteer and advocate for the crew and their families, and I am
      grateful for the support of these parties over the last 20 years.
      <br />
      <br />
      Nine men from The Joe Noyes Crew remain officially Missing in Action
      today, and I've always felt great sadness for the families they left
      behind in 1943. Years ago, I built a simple website as an online memorial
      to their short but inspiring lives and to share their stories with
      interested parties worldwide. May we never forget them and their enduring
      sacrifice.
