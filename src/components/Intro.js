            and I work as a Senior Software Engineer for Lockheed Martin Space,
            located in Colorado. For over twenty years, I have been
            independently researching and sharing the life story of Flight
            Officer Joseph H. Noyes, from Seattle â€” a Flying Fortress pilot who
            served with the 95th Bomb Group (H) during the Second World War.

            As a teenager, I became uniquely fascinated with World War Two, and
            The Mighty Eighth Air Force, and I spent countless hours immersed in
            military history reading material. Then, I stumbled across the book
            B-17s Over Berlin on a shelf at a bookstore and noticed a group
            photograph within its pages, and in that photograph, by some
            destiny, I found Joe Noyes.

            In answer to a question I get asked frequently, I am not related to
            anyone who served on The Joe Noyes Crew or a veteran of the 95th
            Bomb Group (H). I am a volunteer and advocate for the crew and their
            families, and I am grateful for the support of these parties over
            the last 20 years.

            Nine men from The Joe Noyes Crew remain officially Missing in Action
            today, and I've always felt great sadness for the families they left
            behind in 1943. Years ago, I built a simple website as an online
            memorial to their short but inspiring lives and to share their
            stories with interested parties worldwide. May we never forget them
            and their enduring sacrifice.
