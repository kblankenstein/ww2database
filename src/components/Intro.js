            Welcome! My name is Kimberly Blankenstein, and I'm a Senior Software
            Engineer at Lockheed Martin Space, located in Colorado. I know you
            just got here, but I want to thank you for visiting my website!

            For a little over twenty years now, I have been independently
            researching and sharing the life story of Flight Officer Joseph H.
            Noyes, from Seattle â€” a Flying Fortress pilot who served with the
            95th Bomb Group (H) during the Second World War.

            As a teenager, I became uniquely fascinated with World War Two, and
            The Mighty Eighth Air Force, and I spent countless hours immersed in
            military history reading material. Then, I stumbled across the book
            B-17s Over Berlin on a shelf at a bookstore and noticed a group
            photograph within its pages, and in that photograph, by some
            destiny, I found Joe Noyes.

            Please know that I am not related to anyone who served on The Joe
            Noyes Crew or a veteran of the 95th Bomb Group (H). I am simply a
            volunteer and advocate for this crew and their families. I spend my
            own money to host this website and continue with my research
            project. If you would like to help buy me a coffee or a beer, I do
            accept donations through the PayPal link at the bottom of this page.

            Nine men from The Joe Noyes Crew remain officially Missing in Action
            today, and I've always felt great sadness for the families they left
            behind in 1943. Years ago, I built a simple website as an online
            memorial to their short but inspiring lives and to share their
            stories with interested parties worldwide. May we never forget them
            and their enduring sacrifice.
